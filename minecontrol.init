# minecontrol.init - global, per server init file
#  This file is read by minecontrol everytime a new server is executed.
# Some of these properties apply to how the Minecraft server process is
# executed each time the user starts it up. Others are only used when 
# the server is created for the first time.
#  This file is not necessary for minecontrol to function; minecontrol
# will revert to internal defaults if properties are left unspecified.
# Also, minecontrol will not create this file. This commented version
# was supplied with the minecontrol Debian software package.
#  Minecontrol author: Roger P. Gee <rpg11a@acu.edu>

# Path to Java executable (default is /usr/bin/java)
#exec=/usr/bin/java

# Command line for Java Minecraft server; this does not include the
# typical executable name as the first argument (minecontrol provides
# this internally using the "exec" property). The default value is
# seen below.
#cmd-line=-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui
cmd-line=-Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar /mnt/tmpdisk/minecraft_server.1.7.9.jar nogui

# Server time for each server process (default is 4 hours)
#server-time=4

# Max servers restricts number of running minecraft server processes
# (default is virtually unrestricted at 65535)
#max-servers=1

# Alternate home specifies another directory root for users. By default,
# minecontrol uses the normal home directory that the system provides
# for an authenticated user (the one specified in the system password
# file). If alt-home is specified, Minecraft servers are creating in
# directories that are sub-directories of alt-home/user-name/minecraft/
# as opposed to user-home-dir/minecraft/.
#alt-home=/minecraft-data
alt-home=/mnt/tmpdisk/

# You can specify default properties for the server.properties file;
# these are only applied if the user is creating a new server and
# if the property had not previously been specified by the user when
# creating the server in minecontrol. Use the format:
#  default-[PROPERTY-NAME]=[VALUE] (see example with server-port 
# property below)
#default-server-port=40100

# You can also specify override properties; these are applied only if
# the user is creating a new server. If the user specifies this property
# when creating the server it takes no effect and is overrided by the 
# property specified here. This is somewhat effective at letting the 
# administrator choose initial properties for a server without the user
# having to know the details about the system (like port numbers, world-size
# restrictions, ETC.). Use the format:
#  override-[PROPERTY-NAME]=[VALUE]
#override-server-port=40101
